      "Respondents converge on a multifaceted view that unemployment is driven by\n",
      "skills mismatches, structural barriers, and insecure labour market practices,\n",
      "and should be addressed through a mix of active labour market policies\n",
      "(training, apprenticeships, and industry collaboration), targeted social\n",
      "supports (mental and physical healthcare, benefits, and protections for\n",
      "disadvantaged groups), and place-based job creation (public investment,\n",
      "infrastructure, and green jobs). Debate exists between calls for stronger safety\n",
      "nets (increased benefits or UBI and extended support) and calls for\n",
      "conditionality and personal responsibility, while many answers highlight the\n",
      "need to adapt regulation and business incentives to protect gig, self-employed,\n",
      "and precarious workers. Cross-cutting concerns include discrimination and bias\n",

      "      IDENTIFIED THEMES\n",
      "==============================\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 1: SKILLS, EDUCATION, RETRAINING\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Calls for investment in education, upskilling and lifelong learning to address skills mismatches between jobseekers and market demands.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Many respondents see skills gaps as a primary driver of unemployment and want government-led, accessible training—from digital literacy to STEM and vocational routes—often emphasizing industry collaboration so training matches employer needs; this implies policies prioritising funding for adult education, targeted retraining for displaced workers, and stronger links between education providers and employers.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on providing more comprehensive job training programs. They need to invest in upskilling the workforce to match current market demands.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the root causes of unemployment, such as lack of education and skills mismatch. They should invest more in vocational training and apprenticeship programs.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the skills gap in the job market. They should work more closely with industries to identify needed skills and create targeted training programs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 2: SUPPORT FOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Requests for targeted policies and stronger enforcement to improve employment access for groups facing systemic barriers (disabled people, older workers, ex-offenders, refugees, carers).\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents repeatedly call for tailored interventions—accessibility improvements, anti-discrimination enforcement, incentives for employers, second-chance programs and streamlined qualification recognition—signalling that a one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient and that equity-focused measures are needed to bring marginalised people into sustainable work.\n",

      "    > \"The government should provide more support for people with disabilities seeking employment. They need to enforce anti-discrimination laws more strictly and provide incentives for companies to create more inclusive workplaces.\"\n",

      "THEME 3: HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH BARRIERS\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Concerns about physical and mental health problems, and healthcare access, that prevent people from being job-ready.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Multiple respondents link unemployment to healthcare backlogs and insufficient mental health services, indicating that employment policy must be integrated with healthcare provision (reducing waiting times, expanding therapy and support) to remove medical and psychological barriers to work and reduce long-term exclusion.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"Additionally, improving access to mental health support for the unemployed could help many overcome barriers to finding work.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the healthcare backlog that's preventing many unemployed people from being fit for work. I've been waiting months for a necessary surgery, which is delaying my ability to seek employment.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for mental health services. Many long-term unemployed individuals struggle with depression and anxiety, which can be significant barriers to finding work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 4: INCOME SUPPORT AND WELFARE\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Divergent views on unemployment benefits and safety nets, ranging from advocating increased/extended benefits or UBI to favouring time-limited support and conditionality.\n",
      "  Interpretation: There is a clear split between those who want stronger financial safety nets (including UBI and extended benefits) to stabilise jobseekers and those who argue for limits to benefits to incentivise job search; policymakers must balance income security with labour market activation and consider mixed models that provide basic security while encouraging retraining and work entry.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should implement a universal basic income to provide a safety net for all citizens.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should increase unemployment benefits to provide better support during job searches. They should also extend the duration of these benefits, especially given the current economic climate.\"\n",
      "    > \"They could offer tax breaks or subsidies to companies that participate in such programs. However, there should also be a time limit on unemployment benefits to encourage active job seeking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 5: GIG ECONOMY AND SELF-EMPLOYMENT\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Concerns about protections, benefits, and financial stability for gig, freelance and self-employed workers, including late payments and complex benefit interactions.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents want clearer employment status rules, better access to benefits, protection from exploitative practices (late payments, zero-hours), and simplified systems for self-employed support, implying a need to modernise labour protections and social insurance to cover non-standard work forms.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to provide more support for the self-employed and gig economy workers. They should improve access to benefits and protections for these workers.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the growing gig economy and ensure that these workers have adequate protections and benefits. They should clarify the employment status of gig workers and ensure they have access to sick pay, holiday pay, and other basic rights.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of late payments, which can cause significant problems for self-employed individuals and small businesses. They should enforce stricter penalties for large companies that consistently pay invoices late.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 6: PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND JOB CREATION\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Calls for government-led job creation through public sector roles, infrastructure projects, and green/renewable initiatives to stimulate employment.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Many respondents suggest direct public investment as a means to create employment—especially in depressed regions and green industries—indicating appetite for active fiscal policies (public works, green infrastructure, home insulation programs) that both reduce unemployment and meet broader policy goals like decarbonisation.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to create more public sector jobs, especially in economically depressed areas. They should invest in infrastructure projects that could provide employment opportunities.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on supporting green industries and sustainable technologies. This could create new job opportunities while also addressing climate change.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should invest more in green infrastructure projects as a way to create jobs. They could launch a national home insulation program or expand renewable energy initiatives.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 7: SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Support for reducing regulatory burdens, providing grants/loans and mentoring to help small businesses and startups create jobs.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents view small businesses and social enterprises as key job creators and ask for tax relief, simplified rules and targeted finance—suggesting policy packages that reduce administrative friction while providing direct support and capacity-building for local entrepreneurs and cooperatives.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, as they are key job creators. They should offer more grants and low-interest loans to startups and small businesses.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should reduce regulations and taxes on small businesses to encourage entrepreneurship. They should also provide more support and mentoring programs for people looking to start their own businesses.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for people looking to start cooperatives or worker-owned businesses. They should offer specialized training, grants, and legal support for these alternative business models.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 8: REGIONAL, HOUSING AND TRANSPORT BARRIERS\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Concerns that lack of affordable housing, poor transport links and regional disparities restrict access to jobs and contribute to localised unemployment.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents pinpoint geographic constraints—high rents, poor public transport, and rural digital deficits—as structural impediments to labour mobility and job access, implying policies need to combine housing investment, transport improvements and digital infrastructure to open up labour markets across regions.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on regional development to create more job opportunities outside of major cities. They need to invest in rural and post-industrial areas to prevent brain drain and reduce unemployment in these regions.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the housing crisis, which is a significant barrier to employment for many. High rents and lack of affordable housing often trap people in areas with few job opportunities.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on improving transportation infrastructure to connect areas of high unemployment with areas of job growth. They need to invest in affordable and reliable public transportation options.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 9: EMPLOYER PRACTICES AND HIRING REFORM\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Calls to tackle discrimination, unpaid internships, algorithmic bias, and opaque hiring/pay practices to make recruitment fairer and more skills-focused.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Many responses highlight recruitment injustices (ageism, unpaid internships, AI bias, degree inflation) and demand enforcement of laws, promotion of skills-based hiring, and transparency—indicating that labour market access improvements require both legal protections and changes in employer behaviour and HR systems.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"Age discrimination in hiring practices needs to be addressed more seriously. They should also consider providing specialized training programs tailored to the needs of older workers re-entering the job market.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of unpaid internships, which can exploit young workers and exclude those who can't afford to work for free. They should enforce minimum wage laws for internships.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of algorithmic bias in hiring practices. As more companies use AI in recruitment, there's a risk of perpetuating existing inequalities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 10: FLEXIBLE WORK AND WORK-LIFE BALANCE\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Support for part-time, flexible hours, predictable scheduling and work reduction policies (e.g., four-day week) to broaden access to employment.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents argue that flexible arrangements, predictable schedules and options like a four-day week can help parents, older workers and those with caring responsibilities participate in the labour market, suggesting that labour policy should incentivise work patterns that distribute hours and make employment accessible without sacrificing wellbeing.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on creating more part-time and flexible job opportunities, especially for older workers and parents. They should incentivize companies to offer these types of positions.\"\n",
      "    > \"I believe the government should implement a four-day work week. This could help distribute available work more evenly and reduce unemployment.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on promoting work-life balance and reducing overtime culture. By encouraging companies to hire more people for fewer hours each, we could distribute available work more evenly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 11: APPRENTICESHIPS AND EMPLOYER COLLABORATION\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Support for expanding apprenticeship schemes, employer-led training and partnerships with unions to provide practical routes into employment.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents repeatedly endorse apprenticeships and industry-aligned training as pathways into stable work—particularly in trades and emerging sectors—implying a need for funded apprenticeships, quality standards and stronger employer-education collaboration to ensure transitions from training to employment.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on creating more apprenticeship programs, especially in trades and technical fields. They need to work with unions and employers to ensure these programs provide quality training and fair compensation.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on creating more apprenticeship opportunities in emerging industries. They need to work with businesses to develop programs that provide hands-on training and a clear path to employment.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for people looking to relocate for work. They could offer relocation grants or loans to help with moving costs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 12: LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT AND REINTEGRATION\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Calls for specialised interventions for people out of work long-term, including counselling, public works, and second-chance hiring programs.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Several responses emphasise that long-term unemployment needs bespoke support—mental health, tailored counselling, temporary public employment and incentives for second-chance hires—which points to the importance of combining labour market programmes with social supports to prevent entrenched exclusion.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of long-term unemployment more effectively. They should provide specialized support and counseling for those who have been out of work for extended periods.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to improve support for homeless individuals seeking employment. They should provide more funding for programs that offer job training, interview clothing, and other resources to help homeless people find work.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to improve support for people with criminal records seeking employment. They should work with employers to create more second-chance hiring programs and provide incentives for companies that participate.\"\n"
