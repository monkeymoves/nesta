      "==============================\n",
      "Respondents coalesce around two broad priorities: preparing and protecting\n",
      "workers for a changing labour market, and removing structural barriers that\n",
      "prevent people from getting and keeping work. The most frequent prescriptions\n",
      "are expanded skills and retraining programs, targeted support for vulnerable\n",
      "groups (older workers, disabled people, carers, ex-offenders), and stronger\n",
      "protections for precarious and gig-economy workers. Many also call for active\n",
      "job-creation through public investment (infrastructure, green projects, regional\n",
      "development), incentives/regulation to shape employer behaviour, and improved\n",
      "safety nets—while noting barriers such as childcare, housing, healthcare\n",
      "backlogs, transport and digital exclusion. There is a recurring tension between\n",
      "proposals for greater government intervention (UBI, benefit extensions, public\n",
      "works) and voices emphasising personal responsibility and a leaner role for the\n",
      "state. Across suggestions is a consistent focus on fairness, inclusion and\n",
      "adapting policy to technological and economic change.\n",
      "\n",
      "==============================\n",
      "      IDENTIFIED THEMES\n",
      "==============================\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 1: SKILLS AND RETRAINING\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Policies and programs to upskill, reskill, and educate workers across the life-course to address skills gaps and mismatches.\n",
      "  Interpretation: This theme reflects a consensus that labour-market problems are often rooted in skill mismatches and that investment in vocational training, apprenticeships, adult education and digital literacy is a central, proactive solution; it implies demand for sustained, targeted funding and stronger links between education providers and industry to improve employability and adaptability.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on providing more comprehensive job training programs. They need to invest in upskilling the workforce to match current market demands.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the root causes of unemployment, such as lack of education and skills mismatch. They should invest more in vocational training and apprenticeship programs.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should increase funding for adult education and lifelong learning programs. Many unemployed individuals need to retrain or gain new qualifications to re-enter the job market.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 2: PRECARIOUS WORK PROTECTIONS\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Measures to protect workers in insecure arrangements—zero-hours, gig, freelance and underemployed people—by extending benefits, rights and stability.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Many respondents identify precarious contracts and irregular incomes as a major cause of economic insecurity; this indicates demand for policy that clarifies employment status, extends protections and creates safety nets tailored to non-traditional workers, as well as enforcement against exploitative practices.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of zero-hour contracts and underemployment. Many people are technically employed but don't have enough hours or stable income.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to provide more support for the self-employed and gig economy workers. They should improve access to benefits and protections for these workers.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for freelancers and gig economy workers during economic downturns. They need to create a safety net that acknowledges the unique challenges of irregular income.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 3: TARGETED VULNERABLE SUPPORT\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Tailored interventions for groups facing specific barriers—older workers, disabled people, ex-offenders, refugees, neurodiverse individuals and carers.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents repeatedly call for focused strategies (anti-discrimination enforcement, specialized training, accessibility, second-chance hiring) indicating that generic policies are seen as insufficient; this implies a need for differentiated programs and stronger legal and practical supports to integrate marginalized groups into employment.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on creating more opportunities for older unemployed individuals. Age discrimination in hiring practices needs to be addressed more seriously.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for people with disabilities seeking employment. They need to enforce anti-discrimination laws more strictly and provide incentives for companies to create more inclusive workplaces.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to improve support for ex-offenders seeking employment. They should expand programs that provide job training and placement services for those leaving prison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 4: PUBLIC JOB CREATION\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Using public investment—public sector hiring, infrastructure and green projects—to directly generate employment, especially in depressed regions.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Calls for government-led job creation highlight a belief that market-driven recovery alone is insufficient for some areas and sectors; this implies support for place-based investment, public works and green transition programmes as dual-purpose economic stimulus and employment strategy.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to create more public sector jobs, especially in economically depressed areas. They should invest in infrastructure projects that could provide employment opportunities.\"\n",
      "    > \"I think the government should focus on supporting green industries and sustainable technologies. This could create new job opportunities while also addressing climate change.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on regional development to create more job opportunities outside of major cities. They need to invest in rural and post-industrial areas to prevent brain drain and reduce unemployment in these regions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 5: INCOME SUPPORTS AND SAFETY NETS\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Proposals for financial supports—unemployment benefits, universal basic income, pension protections and measures to combat in-work poverty.\n",
      "  Interpretation: There is significant variation in views about the scope and duration of income support, from calls for UBI and extended benefits to demands for time-limited support; this indicates a policy debate balancing poverty prevention and incentives to work, and underscores the practical importance of income security for job search and wellbeing.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should implement a universal basic income to provide a safety net for all citizens. This would allow unemployed individuals to focus on finding meaningful work or starting businesses without the stress of immediate financial ruin.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should increase unemployment benefits to provide better support during job searches. They should also extend the duration of these benefits, especially given the current economic climate.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of in-work poverty. Many employed people are struggling due to low wages and high living costs.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 6: STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO WORK\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Non-labour market obstacles—childcare, housing, healthcare backlogs, transport and the digital divide—that prevent people from accessing employment.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents emphasize that employment policy must go beyond training and wages to address interlocking social infrastructures; tackling these barriers is presented as essential for enabling people to take jobs, relocate for work, and maintain employment, implying cross-sectoral policy coordination.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the healthcare backlog that's preventing many unemployed people from being fit for work. I've been waiting months for a necessary surgery, which is delaying my ability to seek employment.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to improve access to childcare to enable more parents to enter the workforce. They should subsidize childcare costs and encourage the creation of more nurseries and after-school programs.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the housing crisis, which is a significant barrier to employment for many. High rents and lack of affordable housing often trap people in areas with few job opportunities.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 7: EMPLOYER INCENTIVES AND REGULATION\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Tools to shape employer behaviour, including tax incentives, subsidies, stricter enforcement of labour laws, and regulation of internships and restrictive contracts.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Many respondents see a role for the state in nudging or compelling employers to hire, train and treat workers fairly (via tax breaks, penalties, or legal reform), implying appetite for both carrots and sticks in policy design to improve hiring practices and workplace quality.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"I believe the government should create more incentives for businesses to hire and train unemployed individuals. They could offer tax breaks or subsidies to companies that participate in such programs.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of unpaid internships, which can exploit young workers and exclude those who can't afford to work for free. They should enforce minimum wage laws for internships and provide subsidies for small businesses to offer paid internships to unemployed individuals.\"\n",
      "    > \"I believe the government should implement stricter regulations on the use of non-compete clauses in employment contracts. These can unfairly restrict workers' ability to find new jobs or start businesses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 8: FLEXIBLE WORKING AND BALANCE\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Policies promoting part-time roles, predictable scheduling, shorter working weeks and other arrangements to broaden access to work and improve wellbeing.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents link flexible work and better work-life balance to both increased labour market participation (parents, older workers) and the redistribution of available work; this suggests policy interest in incentivising flexible contracts and experimenting with working-time reforms.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on creating more part-time and flexible job opportunities, especially for older workers and parents. They should incentivize companies to offer these types of positions.\"\n",
      "    > \"I believe the government should implement a four-day work week. This could help distribute available work more evenly and reduce unemployment.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on promoting work-life balance and reducing overtime culture. By encouraging companies to hire more people for fewer hours each, we could distribute available work more evenly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 9: AUTOMATION AND AI IMPACTS\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Concerns about technological displacement and the need for retraining, fair sharing of automation benefits, and regulation of algorithmic hiring.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Respondents are alert to both job losses from automation and the risks of biased AI systems, calling for retraining, ethical AI standards and policy measures to ensure technology does not widen inequality, implying a combined focus on labour-market adaptation and governance of new technologies.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the growing automation in various industries. They should invest in retraining programs specifically designed for workers displaced by technology.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government needs to address the issue of automation and its impact on employment. They should work with industries to develop strategies for retraining and redeploying workers affected by automation.\"\n",
      "    > \"I believe the government should focus on promoting ethical AI and ensuring that automation doesn't lead to mass unemployment. They should invest in research on the societal impacts of AI and implement policies to ensure that the benefits of automation are shared broadly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THEME 10: SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "  Definition: Support for startups, small firms, social enterprises and cooperatives through reduced bureaucracy, grants, loans and mentoring to stimulate job creation.\n",
      "  Interpretation: Many responses identify small businesses and social enterprises as key job creators and call for simplified regulation, financing and targeted support; this implies policy scope for boosting local economic resilience and inclusive job growth through entrepreneurship support.\n",
      "  Supporting Quotes:\n",
      "    > \"The government should focus on supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, as they are key job creators. They should offer more grants and low-interest loans to startups and small businesses.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for social enterprises and cooperatives. These types of businesses often prioritize job creation and can provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups.\"\n",
      "    > \"The government should provide more support for people looking to start cooperatives or worker-owned businesses. They should offer specialized training, grants, and legal support for these alternative business models.\"\n"
