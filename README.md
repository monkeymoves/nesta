## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need Python 3.8+ installed.

1.  **Clone the repository and place data:**
    Clone this repository to your local machine - LFS data CSVs are in the `data/raw/` directory.

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Activate it (Windows)
    # .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/01_exploration.ipynb
    ```

**Note:** To run the thematic analysis cells yourself, you will need to provide your own OpenAI API key. For convenience, a sample export has already been provided in the notebook and within the main [analysis document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12BrwzeASjTUqxsiNHTftcSD7gW4P4OOKcdcvdLcTebY/edit?tab=t.0).
